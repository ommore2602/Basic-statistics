# Q3) Three Coins are tossed, find the probability that two heads and one tail are obtained?

Ans: P (Two heads and one tail) = N (Event (Two heads and one tail)) / N (Event (Three
coins tossed)) = 3/8 = 0.375 = 37.5%

# Q4) Two Dice are rolled, find the probability where sum is a) Equal to 1 b) Less than or equal to 4 c) Divisible by 2 and 3 

Ans: Number of possible outcomes for the above event is N (Event (Two dice rolled)) = 6^2 = 36 a.) P (sum is Equal to 1) = ‘0’ zero null nada none. b.) P (Sum is less than or equal to 4) = N (Event (Sum is less than or equal to 4)) / N (Event (Two dice rolled)) = 6 / 36 = 1/6 = 0.166 = 16.66% c.) P (Sum is divisible by 2 and 3) = N (Event (Sum is divisible by 2 and 3)) / N(Event (Two dice rolled)) = 6 / 36 = 1/6 = 0.16 = 16.66%

# Q5) A bag contains 2 red, 3 green and 2 blue balls. Two balls are drawn at random. What is the probability that none of the balls drawn is blue?

Ans: Total number of balls =7 balls N (Event (2 balls are drawn randomly from bag) = 7! / 2! * 5! = (7654321) / (21) * (54321) N (Event (2 balls are drawn randomly from bag) = (76)/ (21) = 21 If none of them drawn 2 balls are blue = 7 – 2 = 5 N (Event (None of the balls drawn is blue) = 5! / 2! * 3! = (54) / (2*1) = 10 P (None of the balls drawn is blue) = N (Event (None of the balls drawn is blue) / N (Event (2 balls are drawn randomly from bag) = 10 / 21

# Q6) Calculate the Expected number of candies for a randomly selected 
Child Below are the probabilities of count of candies for children (ignoring the nature of the child-Generalized view) CHILD Candies count Probability A 1 0.015 B 4 0.20 C 3 0.65 D 5 0.005 E 6 0.01 F 2 0.120 Child A – probability of having 1 candy = 0.015. Child B – probability of having 4 candies = 0.20 Ans: 0.015+0.8+1.95+0.025+0.06+0.24 = 3.09
